## üëã About Me

As a Data Scientist and Generative AI Engineer, I specialize in designing and deploying **premium AI systems** that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world business impact. My passion is building powerful solutions at the intersection of **LLMs, Generative AI, NLP, bots, and cloud data engineering**‚Äîalways with a focus on scalability, reliability, and delivering measurable value.

From **context-aware chatbots and multi-agent automation** to **voice-driven assistants** and advanced document Q&A platforms, I bring hands-on experience developing robust, production-grade applications. I‚Äôve fine-tuned models like GPT, BERT, and Llama, orchestrated intelligent bots with frameworks such as LangChain and LangGraph, and architected cloud-native pipelines on GCP, Vertex AI, and Databricks.

I combine deep technical expertise with a relentless drive for clarity‚Äîtranslating complex results into executive dashboards and compelling visualizations that empower both technical and business teams. Whether automating workflows or unlocking insights from data, I approach every project with energy, a growth mindset, and a commitment to excellence.

**I‚Äôm open to impactful opportunities across Canada and globally‚Äîremote, hybrid, or on-site. If you value innovation, results, and clear communication, let‚Äôs connect.**
